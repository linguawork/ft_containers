What is unordered binary tree?
Abstract. A binary unordered tree is a tree where each internal node has two children
and the relative order of the subtrees of a node is not important
(i.e. two trees are different if they differ only in the respective
ordering of subtrees of nodes).

Application of unordered binary trees
Generating Unordered Binary Trees is 
necessary in both the graph theory and in 
different applications. For example, 
a list of all trees with a given number of internal 
nodes can be used in computer science to test or analyze an algorithm 
for its correctness or computational complexity



So, in Containers we have to implement
ordered binary trees (a variant of which is red black tree)
